    <h1>Things That Make Me Sneeze :</h1>
    <p>I wanted to put together a quick list of stuff that makes me sneeze.
    </p>
    <p>It's because i keep forgetting to avoid stuff, and maybe if i write it down then I'll remember it. Particular the one about the sawdust.
    </p>
    
    <ul type = "disk">
        <li>Dust</li>

        <li>Doing the following:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Cutting some wood using a saw
            </li>
            <li>Forgetting to clean the dust off</li>
            <li>Looking at the cut real close in order to make sure that it's right</li>
            <li>Breathing in</li>
            <ul type = "square">
                <li>It's worse when i breathe in slowly and get a real lung-full of fresh sawdust
